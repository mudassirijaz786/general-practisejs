//more information about double list
/*
    Doubly Linked Lists are almost identical to Singly Linked Lists except there is an additional pointer to previous nodes
    Better than Singly Linked Lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time!
    However, they do take up more memory considering the extra pointer
    Doubly linked lists are used to implement other data structures and certain types of caches
